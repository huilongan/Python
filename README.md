by using Python, which include:

-Dynamic Array 
-Singly-Linked list, Doubly-Linked list
-Array-Based-Stack, Linked-List-Based-Stack
-Array-Based-Queue,Circular-Queue,Linked-list-Based-Queue
-General Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree
-Tree Traversal Algorithms(Preorder,Postorder,Breathfirst,Inorder)
-Maps,Hash Table
-Graphs
-Continue
