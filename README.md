###Data structure in Python

As a object-oriented programming language, Python is much eaiser than Java or C++. Here, I try to implement some ADTs of data structure
by using Python, which include:

-Dynamic Array	

-Singly-Linked list, Doubly-Linked list	

-Array-Based-Stack, Linked-List-Based-Stack	

-Array-Based-Queue,Circular-Queue,Linked-list-Based-Queue	

-General Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree	

-Tree Traversal Algorithms(Preorder,Postorder,Breathfirst,Inorder)	

-Maps,Hash Table	

-Graphs	

-to be Continued
